// The Health service definition. This service is used by the Stanza SDK to allow devs to
//   make decisions about graceful degradation strategies to apply and to make decisions
//   about fail-fast as high up the stack as possible.
// "Keys" - API bearer tokens - are not included in API and should be sent via a X-Stanza-Key header.
// Customer IDs are determined based on the X-Stanza-Key header (each key is associated
// with one and only one customer).
// However, env must always be specified - stanza keys do not have to be
// specific to an environment, so we cannot infer the env from the key.
// Like quota service this should be accessed by SDK via HTTPS.
